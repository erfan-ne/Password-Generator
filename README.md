## 🔐 Password Strength Logic

The password strength is based on the number of selected character types:

| Selected Options | Strength     |
|------------------|--------------|
| 0                | None         |
| 1                | Very Weak    |
| 2                | Weak         |
| 3                | Good         |
| 4                | Strong       |
